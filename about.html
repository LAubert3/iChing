          <h1>About Us</h1>
          <p>
            Welcome to our free online I Ching oracle. The I Ching (易经 Yì
            Jīng), or "Book of Changes," is an ancient Chinese divination text
            that has provided guidance for over 3,000 years. It offers profound
            insights into life's challenges and decisions. Our platform makes
            this timeless wisdom accessible to everyone, allowing you to explore
            its teachings and receive personal readings through the art of
            divination.
          </p>

          <h3>Our Mission:</h3>
          <p>
            Our mission is to make the sacred insights of the I Ching available
            to everyone. By blending tradition with modern technology, we aim to
            empower individuals on their journey of self-discovery,
            decision-making, and personal growth—providing a bridge between
            ancient wisdom and contemporary challenges.

        <section class="about-section">
          <h2>How It Works</h2>
          <p>
            Our platform offers two modes for receiving your personalized I
            Ching readings, both of which are based on the traditional King Wen
            hexagram sequence. In <strong>Manual Mode</strong>, you can simulate
            the coin toss process by selecting the corresponding options for
            your coin flips. In <strong>Auto Mode</strong>, we use the
            <strong
              ><a
                href="https://api.random.org/dashboard"
                target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer"
                >random.org</a
              >
              API</strong
            >, which generates truly random numbers derived from atmospheric
            noise, providing a higher level of randomness compared to methods
            that rely on pseudo-random number generation. Unlike CSPRNGs
            (Cryptographically Secure Pseudo-Random Number Generators), which
            use a combination of algorithms and hardware to generate numbers
            that are deterministic and not truly random, random.org's approach
            taps into the unpredictability of nature, making it a more reliable
            source of randomness for your I Ching reading.
          </p>

          <h3>Manual Mode:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Flip three coins and select the dropdown option that corresponds
              to your toss, then press 'Enter' to generate a line.
            </li>
            <li>Repeat this process six times to generate your hexagram.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Auto Mode:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Create an account on
              <a

              to obtain an API Key.
            </li>
            <li>
              Copy and paste the API key into the input box on our platform.
            </li>
            <li>Click 'Start' to automatically generate your reading.</li>
