      'There is a saying about using troops: ′I do not dare to be the master, but rather the guest; I do not dare to advance an inch, but retreat a foot.′ This is called action without action, grasping without arms, throwing without enemies, holding without weapons. There is no greater disaster than underestimating the enemy; underestimating the enemy almost costs me my treasure. Therefore, when opposing forces clash, the one who grieves wins.',

Only because of ignorance, they do not understand me. Those who understand me are few, and those who follow me are precious. Therefore, the sage wears coarse clothing and carries jade in his heart.',

Only by rejecting a weary mind can one avoid being weary. Therefore, the sage knows themselves but does not make themselves known; loves themselves but does not exalt themselves. Therefore, they abandon what is external and take what is internal.',

The people are difficult to govern because the rulers are too involved in their affairs, thus they are unruly.

The way of Heaven is to reduce what is excessive and to supplement what is lacking. The way of man, however, is different: he takes from the lacking to serve what has surplus.
